									<a href="#">I would like to bid in an auction.</a>
								</div>
								<div class="answer" style="display: none;">
									<span class="sp_icon bul_answer"><span class="hidden">A</span></span>
									<div>There are three ways to make a bid in an auction: phone bid, written bid, and on-site (direct) bid.<br/><br/>
                                    1. Bid applications can be submitted at the exhibition venue during the preview period as well as on the Seoul Auction website. <br/>
                                    Regular registered members of Seoul Auction have the right to make auction bids. Immediately upon completing membership registration via the website, you are eligible to make phone or written bids.<br/>
                                    2. The bid period begins on the first day of the preview exhibition.<br/>
                                    3. For paper (facsimile) bids, the deadline is 7 p.m. on the day before the auction, while for online bid applications, it is 11:59 p.m. on the day before the auction.<br/>
                                    4. Members who wish to make a bid in person at the auction should reserve a seat and paddle in advance by phone.

									<a href="#">What is the difference between associate and regular members?</a>
								</div>
								<div class="answer" style="display: none;">
									<span class="sp_icon bul_answer"><span class="hidden">A</span></span>
									<div>The difference between associate and regular members is the ability to make offline Auction bids.<br/><br/> 
1. Associate member (no membership fee): registered on Seoul Auction website as associate member and can use website services and make bids in online auctions.<br/> 
2. Regular member (membership fee): pays annual membership fee and can use website services and make bids in all Seoul Auction auctions (in case of successful bid, separate commission fee is charged), receive shipment-related services (auction catalogue, etc., during the one-year membership period), and participate in online auctions.<br/> 
* Auction catalogues serve as references to assist regular members in the bidding process. Catalogues are mailed to all regular members before each auction. <br/>
* Current members who are newly applying for regular membership (or have already applied for regular membership via the website but are still associate members because they have not paid the membership fee) should log in to the Seoul Auction website and click the orange payment button under “My Account” to complete the membership application process.</div>

									<span class="sp_icon bul_answer"><span class="hidden">A</span></span>
									<div>Seoul Auction does not sell its catalogues individually. Auction catalogues serve as references to assist regular members in the bidding process and are mailed to all regular members before each auction.<br/> 
	Regular members have a membership period of one year.<br/> 
	Those who wish to apply for regular membership should do so when renewing their membership application or, if they have already applied for associate membership via the website, should log in to the Seoul Auction website and reapply.</div>

									<span class="sp_icon bul_answer"><span class="hidden">A</span></span>
									<div>1.	Those who applied for regular membership via paper application form at an exhibition (auction) venue should also apply for regular membership via the Seoul Auction website and then contact the employee in charge or call Seoul Auction’s main landline (+82-2-2075-4422) to ensure that the online and offline applications are integrated into a single membership account. After confirmation, the membership status will be upgraded to regular membership.<br/> 
	2. Those who applied for associate membership on the website and then paid the regular membership fee in person should write down their ID next to their name on the application form. The employee in charge will then elevate the individual’s status to regular membership. <br/>
	3. Those who applied for regular membership on the website and then paid the regular membership fee in person after their online membership expired should also write their ID next to their name on the application form. The employee in charge will then elevate the individual’s status to regular membership.</div>
