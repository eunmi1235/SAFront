								<p style="font-size:16px; font-weight:600; line-height:30px;">1. Successful bid and bid priority</p>
                                <p style="line-height:30px; font-size:16px;">A successful auction bid is granted to the bidder with the highest bid price. Opportunities for successful bids are granted with priority given to automatic bids, followed by manual bids.<br/>
                                If two identical bids are made, priority will be given to the individual who entered his or her bid price first (based on the time indicated by the server).<br/>
                                When a bid is made, the auction bid increases based on the bid increment.</p>
                                <br/><br/>
                                <p style="font-size:16px; font-weight:600; line-height:30px;">2. Confirmation of successful bid</p>
                                <p style="line-height:30px; font-size:16px;">Once a successful bid has been determined, an email confirmation of the successful bid is sent. The bidder may also confirm the successful bid price and commission fees on the Seoul Auction website (Log in > Account > Auction Transaction Information > Purchase List).<br/>
                                The bidder cannot cancel his or her bid without incurring a penalty. In the event a bid must be cancelled, the bidder’s intention to cancel must be expressed in writing within seven days of the successful bid being made. A penalty corresponding to 30 percent of the successful bid price must be paid within seven days for breach of contract.
                                </p>
